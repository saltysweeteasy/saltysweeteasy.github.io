            <h2>A game of Auction!</h2>
            <p class="p1">Bid Battles is a ROBLOX game created on May 11th, 2022, by the group Absolute Zero. The main
                premise of the game is to obtain items by bidding for storage lockers in auctions, then sell them in
                your shop. This concept is almost certainly based off of the reality TV show Storage Wars and the mobile
                game series Bid Wars. The main currency of the game is cash, and the premium currency is gems. Like most
                ROBLOX games, It is a multiplayer game, with the options to buy, sell, trade, and bid against other
                players. As you progress through the game by earning cash, you unlock new auctions and mechanics. The
                Repair Shop, Hankâ€™s, the Locksmith, the Grading Shop, the Exchange, the Airport, the Sky Plaza, and the
                Bank are buildings found in the center of the surrounding player shops, that each provide a unique game
                mechanic. You may also enter the opened shops of other players and offer for items on sale. The game
                occasionally features events that offer limited and serial items. Game passes, temporary boosts, and
                currency may be purchased with Robux in the shop panel.</p>
